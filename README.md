# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

Tasked to create a day calendar from times 9am-7pm, that know's the current time and date and can save appointments to local storage.
We will use the API called  [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) to create data inputs for time and date.

# Example
The scheduler should work as below: <br>

# Problems
I feel like I may have done a much longer way creating a div for each time slot to make sure there was somewhere to input data. Could probably have found a way to run a loop to create divs based on an array.
I ran into some styling issues due to it using real time and me working on it outside the hours it encompassed, leading to certain colours throughout the sheet that required me to change my pc time to allow for testing. Had to find many bits of code to put together to make the code work together and produce the desired result, a lot of time allocated to complete.
